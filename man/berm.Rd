\title{Bootstrap-Enhanced Regularization Method (BERM)
This function applies a bootstrap-enhanced regularization technique
integrating bootstrapped confidence intervals with elastic net models to
obtain robust variable selection and accurate coefficient estimation.}
\usage{
berm(
  x,
  y,
  lambda_grid = 10^seq(2, -3, by = -0.1),
  alpha_grid = seq(1, 0, length.out = 20),
  standardize = TRUE,
  nfold = 10,
  K = 100,
  unrestricted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix or data frame of predictor variables.}

\item{y}{A vector of the response variable.}

\item{lambda_grid}{A numeric vector of lambda values to be used in regularization.}

\item{alpha_grid}{A numeric vector specifying alpha values to be used in regularization.
This parameter only affects the results when 'unrestricted' is TRUE.}

\item{standardize}{Logical, indicates whether to standardize predictor variables before fitting the model.
Default is standardize=TRUE.}

\item{nfold}{The number of folds for cross-validation, used to optimize model parameters. Default is nfold=10.}

\item{K}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap samples to draw. Default is K=100.}

\item{unrestricted}{Logical, if TRUE, allows 'alpha_grid' to vary; if FALSE, 'alpha_grid' is fixed at 0.5. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing several components:
- 'step1res': A data frame of coefficients across all bootstrap samples.
- 'step1select': A data frame indicating which variables were consistently selected across samples.
- 'step2pars': Model parameters from the final elastic net model.
- 'coef': The estimated coefficients.
- 'intercept': The estimated intercept.
- 'finalmodel': The final model object.
